# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a custom Terraform provider that can flatten YAML files recursively into a map with dot-separated keys and values. The provider will take nested YAML structures and convert them into a flat key-value format where nested objects are represented using dot notation and arrays are represented with index notation in brackets.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to use a Terraform provider to flatten YAML configuration files, so that I can easily convert nested YAML structures into flat key-value pairs for use in other Terraform resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a YAML file is provided as input THEN the provider SHALL parse the YAML content successfully
2. WHEN the YAML contains nested objects THEN the provider SHALL flatten them using dot notation (e.g., "parent.child.key")
3. WHEN the YAML contains arrays THEN the provider SHALL flatten them using bracket notation with indices (e.g., "parent.array[0].key")
4. WHEN the YAML contains mixed nested structures THEN the provider SHALL handle both objects and arrays correctly in the same flattening operation
5. IF the YAML file is invalid or cannot be parsed THEN the provider SHALL return a clear error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Terraform user, I want the provider to support recursive flattening of deeply nested YAML structures, so that I can handle complex configuration files with multiple levels of nesting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the YAML contains multiple levels of nesting THEN the provider SHALL flatten all levels recursively
2. WHEN arrays contain objects with nested properties THEN the provider SHALL flatten the entire structure correctly
3. WHEN objects contain arrays that contain objects THEN the provider SHALL maintain proper key hierarchy
4. WHEN the flattening depth exceeds reasonable limits THEN the provider SHALL handle it gracefully without stack overflow

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Terraform configuration author, I want the provider to expose the flattened data through both data sources and functions, so that I can reference the flattened values in different ways throughout my Terraform configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the data source THEN the provider SHALL expose the flattened result as a map attribute
2. WHEN using the provider function THEN the provider SHALL return the flattened map directly for inline usage
3. WHEN accessing flattened keys through either method THEN the provider SHALL return the correct string values
4. WHEN the provider is used in a Terraform plan THEN it SHALL show the expected flattened output for both data source and function usage
5. WHEN the provider is used in a Terraform apply THEN it SHALL make the flattened data available to other resources through both access methods

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the provider to handle different YAML data types correctly, so that the flattened output preserves the original data semantics where possible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the YAML contains string values THEN the provider SHALL preserve them as strings in the flattened output
2. WHEN the YAML contains numeric values THEN the provider SHALL convert them to strings in the flattened output
3. WHEN the YAML contains boolean values THEN the provider SHALL convert them to string representations ("true"/"false")
4. WHEN the YAML contains null values THEN the provider SHALL represent them as empty strings or handle them appropriately
5. WHEN the YAML contains special characters in keys or values THEN the provider SHALL handle them without corruption

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Terraform user, I want the provider to accept YAML content through multiple input methods, so that I can use it flexibly in different scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN providing YAML content directly as a string THEN the provider SHALL process it successfully
2. WHEN providing a file path to a YAML file THEN the provider SHALL read and process the file content
3. IF the specified file path does not exist THEN the provider SHALL return a clear error message
4. IF the file cannot be read due to permissions THEN the provider SHALL return an appropriate error message

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a Terraform user, I want to use the YAML flattening functionality as both a provider function and a data source, so that I have flexibility in how I integrate it into my Terraform configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing as a provider function THEN the provider SHALL allow inline usage within expressions and resource configurations
2. WHEN implementing as a data source THEN the provider SHALL allow the flattened data to be referenced as data source attributes
3. WHEN using the function approach THEN the provider SHALL accept YAML content as function parameters
4. WHEN using the data source approach THEN the provider SHALL accept YAML content through data source configuration blocks
5. WHEN both implementations are available THEN they SHALL produce identical flattened output for the same input

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want the provider to be hosted in a GitHub repository under the "Perun-Engineering" organization, so that it can be properly managed, versioned, and distributed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is created THEN it SHALL be hosted in a GitHub repository under the "Perun-Engineering" organization
2. WHEN the repository is set up THEN it SHALL include proper README documentation with usage examples
3. WHEN the repository is configured THEN it SHALL have appropriate branch protection rules for the main branch
4. WHEN contributors make changes THEN the repository SHALL require pull requests for code review
5. WHEN the project structure is established THEN it SHALL follow standard Go project layout conventions

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated CI/CD workflows that build the provider for multiple architectures, so that users can install the provider on different platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to the repository THEN GitHub Actions SHALL automatically trigger build workflows
2. WHEN the build workflow runs THEN it SHALL compile the provider for multiple architectures (linux/amd64, linux/arm64, darwin/amd64, darwin/arm64, windows/amd64)
3. WHEN builds complete successfully THEN the workflow SHALL generate provider binaries for each target architecture
4. WHEN builds fail THEN the workflow SHALL provide clear error messages and fail the CI pipeline
5. WHEN pull requests are created THEN the build workflow SHALL run automatically to validate changes

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want automated security scanning integrated into the CI/CD pipeline, so that vulnerabilities are detected early in the development process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed THEN GitHub Actions SHALL run security scanning workflows automatically
2. WHEN security scans execute THEN they SHALL check for known vulnerabilities in Go dependencies
3. WHEN security scans execute THEN they SHALL perform static code analysis for security issues
4. WHEN vulnerabilities are detected THEN the workflow SHALL fail and provide detailed reports
5. WHEN security scans pass THEN the workflow SHALL allow the pipeline to continue

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a Terraform user, I want the provider to be automatically published to the Terraform Registry when new releases are created, so that I can easily install and use the provider.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new release tag is created THEN GitHub Actions SHALL automatically trigger the publishing workflow
2. WHEN the publishing workflow runs THEN it SHALL build signed provider binaries for all supported architectures
3. WHEN binaries are built THEN the workflow SHALL generate proper checksums and signatures
4. WHEN the release is ready THEN the workflow SHALL automatically publish the provider to the Terraform Registry
5. IF the publishing process fails THEN the workflow SHALL provide clear error messages and notifications
